you have been given below code snippet (calculating an average score), with intermediate output

type ScoreCollector = (Int, Double)
type PersonScores   = (String, (Int, Double))

val initialScores = Array(("Fred", 88.0), ("Fred", 95.0), ("Fred",91.0), ("Wilma", 93.0), ("Wilma", 95.0), ("Wilma", 98.0))
val wilmaAndFredScores = sc.parallelize(initialScores).cache()

createScoreCombiner 
scoreCombiner
scoreMerger

val scores = wilmaAndFredScores.combineByKey(createScoreCombiner, scoreCombiner, scoreMerger)
val averagingFunction = (personScore: PersonScores) => {
