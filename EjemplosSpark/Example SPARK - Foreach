Write a spark program, which will join the data based on first and last name and save the joined results in following format
first,last,technology,salary

val technology    = sc.textFile("/user/cloudera/spark12/technology.txt")
val salary        = sc.textFile("/user/cloudera/spark12/salary.txt")

val technologyRDD = technology.map(t => ( (t.split(",")(0), t.split(",")(1)), (t.split(",")(2))))
val salaryRDD 	  = salary.map(t => ( (t.split(",")(0), t.split(",")(1)), (t.split(",")(2))))

val joined = technologyRDD.join(salaryRDD)
joined.take(10).foreach(println)

joined.repartition(1).saveAsTextFile("/user/cloudera/spark12/multicolum.txt")
