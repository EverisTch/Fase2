Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common and should be automatically handled by the framework

spark3/sparkdir2/file2.txt
The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a processing part called MapReduce. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. To process data, Hadoop transfers packaged code for nodes to process in parallel based on the data that needs to be processed.

his approach takes advantage of data locality nodes manipulating the data they have access to to allow the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking

# now write a spark code in scala which will load all these three files from hdfs and do the word count by filtering following words.
# and result should be sorted by word count in reverse order.

# filter words ("a","the","an","as","a","with","this","these","is","are","in","for","to","and","The","of")

# also please make sure you load all three files as a Single RDD

# you have also been given following codec
import org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec

# please use above codec to compress file, while saving in hdfs
